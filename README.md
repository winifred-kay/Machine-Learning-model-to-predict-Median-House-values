# Machine-Learning-model-to-predict-Median-House-values
A machine learning model designed using the stochastic gradient descent and random forest to predict median house values while adopting the CRISP DM framework. Machine learning is the development of computer programs that can access data, and through that a series of algorithms use the data to learn and make predictions for the future.
# About project
This project is a supervised machine learning model that predict the  prices of houses using the carlifornia census data. This data is presented with metrics and information that is used to train models for future predictions.

# Relevance Of Project
The goal of the project was to build a model that helps real estate industries in pricing houses more effectively according to the current market. It was an aim to also improve my machine learning skill with a beginner project.  Also to help individuals seeking to buy apartment to know the median price in the market to avoid being scammed.
